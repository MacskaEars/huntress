## Coming soon

I'm rewriting all.py and will remove the other python files. One unified python script will be the primary source, then a webpage made from that if need be - I may be able to host the python after all, but we'll see. It depends on a few factors like installations of the requirements/dependencies (they're simple and trusted but one service I tried only allowed 3 dependencies) and compliance with rate limits of the API's it accesses.
