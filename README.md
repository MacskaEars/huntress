Automate searches for jobs/apartments/etc. for free, no phone/account/etc. required.

Click the 'request' folder above to see how to request a new feature and/or report an issue.

## Coming soon

all.py (for a single script that runs everything)

requirements.txt (for easy installation of requirements if I can't work around the need) - as well as setup/ folder for a guide with images.

Currently the requirements are added in-line for ease of use, I will modify this in the future once I can host the code elsewhere (likely a Django server for convenience.)

If you want me to make some money on this, all I have is: [https://buymeacoffee.com/macskaears](https://buymeacoffee.com/macskaears)
